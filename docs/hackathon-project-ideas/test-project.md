# Smart Waste Management System

## Overview
Develop a smart waste management system that uses IoT sensors to monitor waste levels in bins and optimize collection routes for waste management trucks.

## Features
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Use sensors to detect the fill level of waste bins.
- **Data Analytics**: Analyze data to predict waste generation patterns.
- **Optimized Routes**: Implement algorithms to optimize collection routes based on real-time data.
- **User Interface**: Create a dashboard for waste management authorities to monitor and manage waste collection efficiently.

## Technologies
- IoT Sensors
- Cloud Computing (e.g., AWS, Azure)
- Data Visualization Libraries (e.g., D3.js, Chart.js)
- Mobile App Development (e.g., React Native, Flutter)

## Potential Impact
This project can significantly reduce operational costs for waste management and improve the efficiency of waste collection processes, leading to a cleaner environment.
